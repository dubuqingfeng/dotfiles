description="Create a custom slash command following Claude Code specifications"
prompt = """
## Context

- Project commands live in `.claude/commands/` and are shared with the team.
- Personal commands live in `~/.claude/commands/` and are available across repositories.
- Every generated command must follow the Claude Code slash command specification.

## Requirements

### Command Scopes

- **Project commands** — Stored in `.claude/commands/` and committed to source control.
- **Personal commands** — Stored in `~/.claude/commands/` for individual reuse.

### Core Features

- Organize commands with directory namespacing.
- Support dynamic arguments through `<the user input (user may provide additional)>`, `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- Run bash setup commands with the ```` prefix.
- Reference files and folders via the `@` prefix.
- Include extended thinking keywords when deeper reasoning is required.
- Configure metadata through frontmatter.

### Frontmatter Options

- **`allowed-tools`** — Declare permitted tools (e.g. `Bash(git add:*), Write`).
- **`argument-hint`** — Provide autocomplete hints (e.g. `[Project|Personal] [description]`).
- **`description`** — Summarize the command intent.
- **`model`** — Pick the Claude model (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`, `claude-opus-4-1-20250805`).

### Argument Handling

- `<the user input (user may provide additional)>` captures the full argument string, e.g. `/fix-issue 123 high-priority`.
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3` capture individual positions, e.g. `/review-pr 456 high alice`.

### Command Creation Process

1. Determine whether the command is Project or Personal (default Project).
2. Extract the requested behavior from the remaining arguments.
3. Generate a descriptive kebab-case command name.
4. Create the target directory if it does not already exist.
5. Author the Markdown command with frontmatter, context, and instructions.
6. Add optional enhancements (arguments, bash commands, file references).

## Your Task

1. Analyze `<the user input (user may provide additional)>` to determine the command scope and intent.
2. Produce the Markdown command content following the specification and creation process.
3. Present the completed command ready for placement in the correct directory.

### Reference Examples

```bash
/create-command Review pull request with security focus
/create-command Project Generate API documentation from code
/create-command Personal Optimize database performance analysis
/create-command Project Create comprehensive unit tests
```

### Illustrative Templates

**Bash Command with Git Operations**

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: Bash(git add:*), Bash(git status:*), Bash(git commit:*)
description: Create a git commit
---

## Context
- Current git status: `git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): `git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: `git log --oneline -10`

## Your task
Based on the above changes, create a single git commit.
```

**File References**

```markdown
---
description: Review code implementation
---

# Reference a specific file
Review the implementation in @src/utils/helpers.js

# Reference multiple files
Compare @src/old-version.js with @src/new-version.js
```

**Positional Arguments**

```markdown
---
argument-hint: [pr-number] [priority] [assignee]
description: Review pull request
---

Review PR #$1 with priority $2 and assign to $3.
Focus on security, performance, and code style.
```

**Note:** The user may provide additional input after the command. Use that input as <the user input> in the instructions above.
