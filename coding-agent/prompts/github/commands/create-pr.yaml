  your_task:
    body: |-
      1. Validate repository readiness, analyse change scope, and detect any blockers.
      2. Run the necessary quality and security checks; resolve failures by collaborating with specialized agents when required.
      3. Assemble the pull request with the prescribed structure, link issues, apply labels, and report the final status to the team.

      ### Workflow Steps

      1. **Repository Validation** - Check authentication and branch status
      2. **Change Analysis** - Analyze commits and file changes
      3. **Quality Validation** - Run project-specific quality checks
      4. **Security Scanning** - Check for sensitive data exposure
      5. **Issue Discovery** - Find and link related issues
      6. **PR Creation** - Generate and create pull request with proper metadata

      ### Quality Validation Process

      **Node.js Projects:**

      - Run lint, test, build, and type-check commands
      - Validate package.json changes
      - Check for security vulnerabilities

      ### Security Validation

      - Scan for sensitive files (.env, .key, .pem)
      - Check for hardcoded secrets, passwords, tokens
      - Validate input sanitization in changed files
      - Ensure no credentials in commit history

      ### Pre-Creation Requirements

      - Repository state validated and clean
      - All quality checks passed (lint, test, build)
      - Security scan completed without issues
      - Related issues identified and linked
      - Proper branch naming and commit messages following standards

      ### Failure Resolution Process

      When quality checks fail:

      1. Use TodoWrite to create specific task list for failures
      2. Use Task tool with specialized agents:
         - **@code-reviewer** — logic correctness, tests, error handling.
         - **@security-reviewer** — authentication, data protection, validation.
      3. Fix issues systematically with validation after each fix
      4. Mark tasks completed immediately after resolution
      5. Re-run quality checks until all pass

      ### PR Structure Requirements

      **Title Guidelines:**

      - Maximum 70 characters
      - Use imperative mood
      - No emojis
      - Clear and descriptive

      **Body Template:**

      ```markdown
      ## Summary
      Brief description of changes and business impact

      ## Changes
      - List of key modifications
      - Technical details and rationale

      ## Related Issues
      Fixes #123, Closes #456

      ## Testing
      - [ ] Unit tests added/updated
      - [ ] All tests pass
      - [ ] Manual testing completed
      - [ ] Edge cases covered

      ## Security & Quality
      - [ ] No sensitive data exposed
      - [ ] Input validation implemented
      - [ ] Linting and type checking passed
      - [ ] Build successful

      ## Type of Change
      - [ ] Bug fix
      - [ ] New feature
      - [ ] Breaking change
      - [ ] Documentation update
      ```

      ### Automated Labeling

      - `testing` - Test file modifications
      - `documentation` - Documentation updates
      - `dependencies` - Package file changes
      - `security` - Security-related modifications

      ### Commit Message Validation

      {{ fragment:git/commit-standards }}
      - Review all commits in branch for compliance
      - Handle non-standard commits by documenting in PR description or interactive rebase if safe

      ### Best Practices

      - **Quality-first**: All checks must pass before PR creation
      - **Security validation**: Comprehensive scanning for vulnerabilities
      - **Issue linking**: Connect PRs to related issues with auto-closing keywords
      - **Small, focused changes**: Easier to review and merge
