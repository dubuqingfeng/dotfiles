label: "GitHub Copilot / Codex"
summary: >-
  Copilot Chat and Copilot Workspace rely on plain-text prompt assets and rich
  documentation. Prompts are typically stored as Markdown snippets that can be
  pasted or referenced via notebooks.
outputs:
  prompts: "dist/codex/prompts/{plugin}-{slug}.md"
  snippets: "dist/codex/snippets/{plugin}/{slug}.code-snippets"
requirements:
  format: markdown
  include_examples: true
  supports_bang_commands: false
notes:
  - Encourage terse task framing followed by numbered action plans.
  - Provide optional code fences with illustrative patterns for Copilot to
    condition on.
  - Snippet output is useful when mapping prompts to VS Code key bindings.
