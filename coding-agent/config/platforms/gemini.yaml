summary: >-
  Gemini for VS Code stores reusable prompts as TOML command files under
  `~/.gemini/commands`. Each command exposes a `description` and `prompt`
  field, optionally namespaced by subdirectories (e.g. `git/commit.toml`).
outputs:
  commands: "dist/gemini/commands/{plugin}/{slug}.toml"
  docs: "dist/gemini/docs/{plugin}/{slug}.md"
requirements:
  format: toml
  literal_newlines: true
  max_prompt_length: 8000
notes:
  - Multi-line prompts must be wrapped in triple quotes within TOML files.
  - Gemini does not evaluate bang shell syntax; convert context commands into
    narrative instructions.
  - Namespacing commands by workflow (e.g. `git/`, `review/`) keeps the command
    palette organized.
